# Trading_Data_Project
Personal Project for providing stats for Csv files of trade logs

So far I have a console version in c with is the 1.0 version
To eanble the program to work properly you must add your csv file to the file folder and then edit line # of the c code in order to access the file data
**Future iterations will be solving the issue of having to access code for this

The python version is for future iterations, hopefully with a web app devlopment
